# trunic

**IMPORTANT: If you have not played the game TUNIC and intend to play it, it is strongly unadvised to use this app and to read this README further, as it is basically a big game spoiler.**

Trunic Drawer is a web tool that draws for you Trunic text (Trunic is the secret writing system used in the game [TUNIC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/))

If you want to get well-drawn Trunic runes to talk with someone in Trunic, use Trunic text for a project such as an artwork or comic, or just want to play with the writing system, this app is for you!

This is a relatively simple web app, as it does not use any framework and **does not have any backend**: only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS! 

Please note that this app is for people who **already know** what their Trunic text will look like. If you do not know how Trunic works, or you want to get Trunic text without thinking about phonetics, this is maybe not the right app for you.


## How to deploy

Well, simply download the code and run `index.html` in your favorite browser. That's it.


## How to use? (Easy way)

To write a Trunic rune (consonant + vowel), press a consonant button, then a vowel button. Text will be written in the input. If you want to write a dotted rune (vowel + consonant), just change the order of buttons.

If you want to write a rune with only a vowel or only a consonant, press the same vowel/consonant button twice.

Then, press Draw to draw the Trunic runes. You may then download the result as PNG or SVG. You can also resize the box or change the foreground/background colors if you want, before downloading.


## How to use? (Hard way)

You can also directly type text, if you know the tool and want to go faster. Remember that consonant part is always uppercase, vowel case is always lowercase, and a dash has to be put between each rune (so the tool knows where a rune begin and where a rune ends).

What you should write is shown in each button (for example, for the syllable */Î¸a/*, you have to write THa)

Then, press Draw to draw the Trunic runes. You may then download the result as PNG or SVG. You can also resize the box or change the foreground/background colors if you want, before downloading.
